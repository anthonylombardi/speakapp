 Our company is moving to Shanghai.
They want us to be thereâ€¦
by the end of the year.
How do you feel about it?
 It's certainly worth trying.
 I hate leaving things...
 till the last minute.
 I prefer to finish everything...
 in plenty of time.
 Time's up!
 Hand in your papers.
 What time's our plane?
 Have you got the tickets?
 I'm not sure.
 Hurry up!
 Where's the Underground station?
 It's on the corner,
 across the street.
 Is Sally from Australia?
 No, she's not.
 She's from South Africa.
 Am I right?
 No, I'm afraid you're wrong.
 Where have you been?
 I've been waiting for you...
 for more than an hour.
 I'll never forgive you.
 That's not fair.
 Try looking at it...
 from my point of view.
 I'd advise you...
 to contact a lawyer.
 The insurance company...
 has agreed to pay...
 all the medical expenses.

 Nobody ever phones me.
 Nothing nice ever happens.
 So this is where you live!
 Nice place!
 When did you move in?
 I've been living here...
 since I came to London.
 Make yourself at home.
 Help yourself to a drink.
 There's either white wine...
 or fruit juice.
 Sorry about the mess.
 I hate doing housework.
 It's boring and repetitive.
 I think so too.
 Would you like me...
 to do the washing up?
 Come and spend next weekend...
 at our cottage by the sea.
 We love having guests...
 and we've got plenty of room.
 The most convenient train to catch...
 leaves at ten.
 I'll come and pick you up...
 at the station.
 It's very kind of you...
 to invite us.
 Will Dave be at the meeting?
 He might be,
 but I very much doubt it.
 What do you think I should do?
 I wouldn't do anything.
 I'd wait and see what happens.
 You never know,
 his story might even be true.
 Electronic devices...
 may not be used...
 during the flight.
