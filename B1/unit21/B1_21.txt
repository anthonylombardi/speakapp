 Hi, Mike!
 How's the new job?
 Do you get along well with your colleagues?
 Guess what -
 I'm coming to Newcastle.
 What about meeting for lunch.
 I'll be free around one.
 How does that sound?
 I'm looking forward to seeing you...
 and catching up...
 on all the gossip.
 All the best,
 Dan
 What's the latest news on the strike?
 It's been called off.
 If all goes well,
 we'll be home before dark.
 There were over two hundred guests...
 at the reception.
 The host proposed a toast.
 Be careful of pickpockets...
 as you leave the cathedral.
 Thanks for the tip.
 We're going to take off in five minutes.
 Please switch off your cell phones.
 I've got a surprise for you.
 Guess what it is.
 Don't say another word.
 Tell me when we get home.
 What about going out for a meal?
 That sounds great.
 It's difficult to remember...
 all these rules.
 Learning a foreign language...
 takes time and patience.

 I'd like to take...
 a five-minute break.
 The people upstairs
 are driving me crazy.
 This is my friend Rebecca.
 Rebecca's a journalist.
 She is Australian from Melbourne.
 She works for Time magazine.
 Nice to meet you.
 A beautiful Monday morning.
 Good morning.
 Good afternoon.
 Good evening.
 It's getting late.
 I'm getting tired.
 Good night.
 According to our market research,
 the target group...
 is young parents.
 What kind of campaign...
 are you planning?
 TV and radio commercials...
 newspaper and magazine advertising.
 When's the deadline?
 Everything will have to be ready...
 by the end of August.
 All the information you need...
 is in these folders.
 How are things?
 Pretty terrible, actually.
 My car won't start.
 My clients won't pay.
 I won't be able...
 to take any time off...
 until Christmas.
