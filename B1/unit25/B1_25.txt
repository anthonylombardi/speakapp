Could you tell me...
 when to get off for...
 Trafalgar Square?
 Who is it?
 It's me, Jessica.
 Oh, I didn't recognise your voice.
 I've got room in my car...
 for one more person
 Wouldn't it be fun...
 to learn sailing!
 It would probably be...
 horribly expensive.
 a three-month course
 a two-day workshop
 a weekend's fun
 Try and get some sleep -
 you have a long day tomorrow.
 Can you use a computer?
 Can you drive a car?
 Are you a good driver?
 Are you good at sports?
 What foreign languages can you speak?
 Have you got any references?
 I can't come to the meeting...
 this afternoon.
 I'm very busy.
 Can you speak more slowly?
 Can you repeat that?
 Can I see you after the lesson?
 Thank you very much.
 Tell us exactly what happened.
 Dinner was over...
 and several of the guests...
 had ordered drinks.

 I saw a woman...
 come into the bar.
 Then I heard the noise.
 It sounded like a gunshot.
 Somebody screamed.
 The woman was lying on the floor.
 At first...
 I thought she was dead.
 I got such a fright...
 I dropped the tray of glasses.
 I've just come back...
 from a week in South Africa.
 Really? Lucky you!
 What was it like?
 The scenery is incredible...
 and the beaches are fantastic.
 We went scuba diving.
 You didn't!
 That must have been such fun!
 It was amazing.
 Hopefully,
 we'll go back at Easter.
 Apparently,
 it's the best time to go.
 The doctor told me...
 to unbutton my shirt.
 Then he asked me...
 to take a deep breath.
 She said she'd waited...
 the whole afternoon.
 He phoned to say...
 he'd been caught in the traffic.
 I failed my driving test...
 for the third time
 Oh, poor you!
 That must have been...
 so disappointing.
 The book was so gripping...
 I couldn't put it down.
