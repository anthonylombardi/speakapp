 Any questions?
 Could you tell me...
 where I can get a ticket?
 Do you know...
 if the last train has left?
 Most accidents...
 are in the home.
 Most of them...
 could easily be avoided.
 Thank you so much for all you've done.
 You've been very kind.
 I really appreciate it.
 It was nothing.
 I'm glad I could help.
 That's what friends are for.
 Max and I...
 have been friends for years.
 We've known each other...
 since we were at school.
 We still keep in touch by e-mail.
 It's been a wonderful evening.
 I had a really good time.
 It was a pleasure.

  I do hope...
 you'll come again soon.
 The results of ... 
 the election were disappointing.
 You look like you've had a bad day.
 Is there a post office near here?
 Yes, it's in the next street...
 near the church.
 Where's the men's department?
 It's upstairs...
 on the first floor.
 Where are the stairs?
 They're over there.
 Can I help you?
 Just looking, thank you.
 How much is this shirt?
 How much are those sunglasses?
 How much is it?
 How much are they?
 Sorry I'm late.
 The traffic's terrible today.
 I don't think you've met my wife.
 No. We have never met.
 I've heard so much about you.
 In a way,
 I feel I already know you.
 They've closed the centre of town to traffic.
 How long has it been closed?
 Since Sunday.
 Do you know...
 if the printer's been fixed yet?
 No, it still isn't working.
 Lightning never strikes...
 in the same place twice.
