How long...
have you been feeling this way?
For a couple of weeks.
You're going to need an X-ray...
and a CT scan.
It may not be anything serious...
but you can't be too careful.
Why are you mad at me?
What did I do?
You forgot my birthday!
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.
Everyone in my office...
is down with the flu.
I'm the only one...
who hasn't got it.
When I finish this report...
I'll have to do the accounts.
It's a job that has to be done...
but it's not a job I enjoy.
When my car broke down,
I had to get the AA...
to send a tow truck.
I met someone last night...
who knows you.
She talked about herself...
the whole evening.
I bumped into an old friend...
at the airport in Frankfurt.
We hadn't seen each other...
since university.
Would you like to join us for dinner?
Thank you, I'd love to.
What does Martin's girlfriend do?
She works for an advertising agency.

 What's she like?
She's tall and slim.
She looks like a fashion model.
How much are those shoes?
The green ones are ninety five.
The red ones are one hundred forty.
Hello?
Hello, Jim. It's Paul.
good - better - best
bad - worse - worst
Don't forget!
Don't worry!
Don't be late!
I told the mechanic...
to check the brakes.
Then I asked him...
to look at the battery.
He advised me to sell the car...
before it fell to pieces.
How come...
the weather's always awful...
at the weekend...
and fine on Monday?
I feel like going to the cinema.
What's on?
the week before
the month before
the year before
the following day
I'm really upset.
How come?
I promised my mother...
I'd be home for her birthday...
but my flight's been cancelled...
because of the strike.
They told me...
they'd give me a refund.
It's the least they can do,
but I won't believe it...
until it actually happens.
