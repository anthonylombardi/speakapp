Do you see what I mean?
Do you think I'm right?
Do you agree?
Not necessarily.
I asked them how they felt...
about their relationship.
What did they say?
She said...
she'd never been so happy.
He said...
he'd always remember...
the first time they'd met.
They were both casually dressed.
He was wearing jeans and a T-shirt.
She had on denim shorts...
and a blue tank top.
Flying always makes me nervous.
Really? I find it relaxing!
Have you got a moment?
Can I ask you some questions?
Sure, go ahead.
How do you get to work?
I usually walk.
Sometimes I take the bus.
Haven't you got a car?
Yes, but I don't use it...
to go to the office.
What time do you leave home?
About seven-thirty.
What do you do?
I work for London Transport.
What an interesting job!
It was one of those times...
when everything seemed to go wrong.

The airline lost our luggage.
Then we missed the ferry.
Most of the hotels and restaurants...
were closed for the winter.
The ones that were open...
were so expensive...
that we almost ran out of money.
It was too cold to go swimming.
Fran was feeling homesick.
In the end...
we came home a week early.
There are only two or three people here...
whose names I know.
Who's that tall, good looking guy?
Which one?
The one with the fabulous tan.
That's Brad Somebody or Other.
I don't really know him.
And who's the pretty girl...
in the sexy red dress?
That's Nancy, my neighbour.
She's awfully nice.
I'll introduce you to her...
if you like.
First, tell me everything...
you know about her.
You'll have a great party...
if you plan it carefully.
Find an evening...
when all of your friends are free.
Work out exactly what you need...
and what it's going to cost.
Thanks for the advice.
I don't know...
what I'd do without you.
It sounds too good to be true.
Don't call before noon.
I'm going to sleep in tomorrow.
Which book did you buy in the end?
The one you recommended.
