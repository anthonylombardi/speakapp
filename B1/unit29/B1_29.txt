Marconi discovered...
how to transmit radio waves.
He moved to England...
to continue his research.
He lived and worked abroad...
for many years.
Did you enjoy the film last night?
How long did it last?
My uncle is a physicist.
My aunt is a biologist.
I studied political science.
I graduated two years ago.
Is it true they're going to freeze...
the price of petrol?
I hope so...
but I don't think so.
Let's move on...
to our next point for discussion.
Would it be alright...
if I took some time off next week?
I have to get my passport renewed.
I suppose so.
If I didn't know him better...
I'd say he was lying.
I don't know him well enough...
to be able to judge.
Nothing ever gets done...
unless I do it.
I beg your pardon?
You're wrong, you know.
I'm sorry to contradict you...
but there's obviously been a mistake.
That's enough!

Perhaps it was...
a misunderstanding.
If only there were some way...
of avoiding a confrontation.
I wish...
you wouldn't keep interrupting.
I wish the bus would come.
Our deadline...
is the day after tomorrow, right?
I'm afraid so.
Well, it won't be my fault...
if we're not ready.
We'd do a much better job...
if we had more time.
What exactly do you mean by that?
I told them the plan wouldn't work...
but nobody would listen.
Lack of funds.
Lack of human resources.
I wish you'd stop being so negative.
Did you have a good holiday?
Where did you go?
We went to Spain.
We had a wonderful time.
What was the weather like?
It wasn't bad.
I have to go now.
I have to meet Maureen...
at ten-fifteen.
Did you have a good time at the party?
Did you meet any interesting people?
I teach - I taught
I buy - I bought
I missed the bus...
and I had to walk.
