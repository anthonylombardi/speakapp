The line was so bad...
I could hardly make out...
what he was saying.
It wasn't our car...
that was blocking the driveway.
It wasn't our dog...
that was barking all night.
I'm sorry I lost my temper.
He's no fool.
She's no beauty.
There's no saying...
how people will react.
The castle stood on a cliff...
overlooking the sea.
We soon realised....
there was no going back.
There was nowhere to sit...
so we had to stand.
When it was my turn to speak...
my mind went blank.
It was an accident, I swear!
I didn't do it on purpose.
I can't stand being laughed at.
It's no use crying over spilt milk.
Shall I pour you a glass of wine?
The play is closing...
after only three performances.
It can't be any good.
Why didn't you call me?
I meant to...
but it slipped my mind.

I'm feeling fed up with life.
Let's go out...
for a breath of fresh air, shall we?
You must be joking!
It's pouring with rain.
You'd better not mention this...
to anyone.
The thought hadn't crossed my mind.
What's the problem?
I've got a terrible pain...
in my back.
My legs hurt...
and I can hardly walk.
Have you had this before?
Yes, I get it about once a year.
Here's the prescription.
once a day
twice a week
three times a month
She gave the book to her son.
She gave her son the book.
He bought some flowers for his mother.
He bought his mother some flowers.
How are things going, work wise?
It's taking me a long time...
to sort out the mess...
my predecessor left.
I can never find anywhere to park.
There's a car park opposite the station...
and another one behind the church.
I'm sorry we won't be spending...
New Year's Eve together.
You needn't worry.
I'll be thinking of you...
as the clock strikes twelve.
Where shall we meet?
I'll be waiting for you...
under the clock.
How will I recognise you?
I'll be all dressed in black...
and carrying a copy...
of the Economist.
