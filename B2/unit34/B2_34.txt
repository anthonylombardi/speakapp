It's no good asking me.
I know nothing about it.
What's the matter?
I'm just feeling sorry for myself.
How come?
I had to walk to work...
because my car was being repaired.
Is that all?
Well, I'm not used to being without it.
Worse things happen, don't they?
You know,
I was just about to say the same thing.
I used to prefer...
working on my own.
I wasn't used to sharing...
ideas and information.
Now I enjoy...
being part of a team.
I'm very fond...
of the people I work with.
Everyone's so nice and friendly.
I'm sorry about last night.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Vast sums of money...
are being spent...
on finding an AIDS vaccine.
How come our order...
still hasn't been sent?
All I can say is I'm sorry.
The delay was caused by a strike.
That's not our fault, is it?

With all due respect,
we cannot continue...
to supply goods...
unless payments are kept up-to-date.
This is outrageous!
I would have thought...
that an old customer like me...
deserved to be treated better.
Can I see you for a few minutes?
No, I've got to go now.
I've got an appointment
I should be free...
at one-thirty.
Shall we meet then?
We've got a date with Susan.
We're going into town...
to see the exhibition.
Would you like to join us?
Shall I open the window?
Shall I close the door?
I can't understand them.
They speak too fast.
What on earth is that?
It's a painting of my Aunt Agatha.
Whoever did it...
didn't know much...
about anatomy.
It was done by a famous French painter.
She left it to me when she died.
So now it belongs to me.
Do you intend to keep it?
We'll see.
For the moment,
I just want to enjoy...
owning a great work of art.
I got rid of all the junk...
in our garage.
I had someone come...
and take it away.
Now there's even room for the car.
