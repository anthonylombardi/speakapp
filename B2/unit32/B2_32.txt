I wish I'd known...
they were so short of money.
Even if you had known...
what could you possibly have done?
I might have been able...
to lend them some.
Don't start blaming yourself.
What's done is done.
I suppose that's one way...
of looking at it.
Please don't bother...
coming to the door.
I'll find my own way out.
Once upon a time...
there was a beautiful princess.
Find out what happens...
in our next thrilling episode.
We set off at dawn...
as we had a long way to go.
If we hadn't had a map...
we might have got lost.
We got invitations...
to the opening night ...
of 'Julius Caesar'.
By the time we got to the theatre...
the first act was over.
Who invented the radio?
When was it invented?
Who did you invite to the party?
Have you got enough wine?
How much do you need?

Can I look at your paper?
Can I listen to your CD?
Spain is bigger than Portugal.
Malta is smaller than Italy.
What's the longest river in Europe?
What's the tallest building in the world?
I always cycle to work.
I wouldn't take public transport...
even if you paid me.
If they improved the system,
more people would use it.
I wish I'd sent that parcel...
by express post.
I wouldn't worry, if I were you.
They'll get it sooner or later.
Whose turn is it now?
It's yours, I think.
I wish I knew...
which card to play.
I'll tell you what happened...
if you promise not to laugh.
I wouldn't have believed it...
if I hadn't seen it ...
with my own eyes.
You can achieve...
more through kindness.
If you go, I'll go.
If you went, I'd go.
If you had gone, I'd have gone.
I'd rather you didn't smoke in here.
Well, I wish you'd told me sooner.
I had a row with my boss...
about his attitude to work.
He makes all the decisions.
Everything that happens...
depends on him.
He tries to do...
too many things at once.
He ought to learn to delegate.
