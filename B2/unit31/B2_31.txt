I've booked a fortnight's holiday...
in Kenya.
It was a real bargain.
The travel agent gave me...
a good discount.
We can leave anytime we like.
Well, you go - I'm not coming.
I mean...
we'll need to get vaccinations...
against yellow fever.
And you know...
how I hate injections.
Besides,
you could at least have asked me first.
I'm sorry...
you couldn't come to the party.
You'd have enjoyed it.
I sat next to a charming woman.
I was sure I'd met her...
somewhere before.
a well-known actress
a well paid job
a recently renovated building
You should have phoned me.
I'd have been only too pleased...
to give you a lift.
You could have saved yourself...
a lot of trouble.
When I came out of the building...
there was a man...
selling lottery tickets.

I bought the last one left...
and I won!
Surely you don't expect me...
to believe that.
I wish you'd do something useful...
instead of watching TV.
Have you seen my purse anywhere?
No, you must have left it at home.
Don't worry.
We'll manage somehow.
I wouldn't bet on it.
Pam and I had lunch
at that new restaurant.
The Italian one.
The one on the corner.
What's it like?
It's good, and it's not expensive.
What did you have?
We had spaghetti.
It was delicious!
Could you pass the salt and pepper?
Could you pass the oil and vinegar?
Could we have our bill, please?
There's some beer in the fridge...
but there isn't any wine.
I'm sorry to bother you...
but I need your advice.
My boss is forever complaining...
about something.
Arguing with her is pointless.
She'll do anything...
to get her own way.
I had a talk with her...
about an increase in salary.
All she said was 'no way'.
I can't go on like this.
Treat other people...
as you'd like to be treated.
They shouldn't have had...
to sell their house.
