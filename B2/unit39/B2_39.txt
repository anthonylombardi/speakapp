The movers couldn't get the piano...
through the front door.
Do you swear to tell the truth...
and nothing but the truth?...
the young - the elderly
the rich - the poor
An attempted robbery...
at a local restaurant...
failed last night.
The robbers...
were wearing fancy dress costumes.
The cashier screamed,
and they ran away.
It began to rain...
while we were having lunch.
It was snowing...
when we got to the hotel.
We checked in at the desk...
and went up to our room.
Do you wear glasses?
No, I wear contact lenses.
I've never been to the Caribbean.
Neither have I.
They say it's a wonderful place...
for a restful holiday.
I've checked...
and double checked the invoice,
but I still can't find the mistake.
It's not at all like you ...
to give up without a fight.
Health insurance...
can be extremely costly...
for self-employed people.
Thank you for reminding me.

I have to be up tomorrow...
at the crack of dawn.
So do I.
But I can't sleep in this heat.
Neither can I.
What took you so long?
The lift got stuck.
May I ask what it is...
that attracts you to the idea...
of living here permanently?
I wonder if you could possibly...
rephrase your question.
Who sent you those roses?
My cousin Kevin.
A sensible diet...
helps to prevent heart attacks,
and so does regular exercise.
Self-confidence ...
is often a determining factor...
in an athlete's performance.
Worrying about things...
doesn't help,
but neither does ignoring them.
She's a difficult person...
to deal with.
She reminds me of someone...
I used to know.
Have you ever been to Scotland?
No, I've never been there.
And I've never been to Wales.
But I've been to Ireland twice.
I've never had any trouble...
with this computer.
It works perfectly.
I never had any trouble...
with my old computer.
It worked perfectly.
Have you met my cousin?
No, we've never met.
Have you sent that fax?
Not yet.
