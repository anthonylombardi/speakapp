If you happen to see Lee...
please give her my regards.
She's a very dear friend of mine.
If only we'd known then...
what we know now.
Did you enjoy the show?
Yes, I did.
It was better than I expected.
We need more information.
We need some good advice.
It's hot in summer.
It's cold in winter.
It's cool in autumn.
It's warm in spring.
Business is not very good this year...
but last year it was worse.
The test wasn't very easy.
It was more difficult than I thought.
We had dinner last night...
at Grandma's Kitchen.
I heard about it...
on the radio.
Who did you go with?
I went with my sister-in-law...
What an experience!
The food was delicious.
Everything was beautifully served...
on lovely old blue and white china...
just like my mother used to have.
It was quite expensive...
but it was worth it.

How nice to see you again.
How you've changed!
I didn't even recognise you.
Didn't you use to have a beard?
Yes, I did.
But that was quite a long time ago.
How time flies!
I saw it on television.
I read about it in the paper.
Earth was once considered...
the centre of the universe.
The news...
spoilt my whole day.
What nice weather we've been having.
I used to love the heat,
but now I can't stand it.
Paul's getting married!
How exciting! 
Who to?
I've been studying so hard,
I even dream in English.
This printer is so simple...
even a child could use it.
At least a dozen eggs.
About half a litre of milk.
Two or three spoonfuls...
of good brandy.
The company is growing.
Business is improving.
How's that new project going?
We're having some problems...
but we're making progress.
We expect to finish...
by the end of November.
The test was too long.
The questions were too difficult.
There were too many people...
and there was too much noise.
The phone's ringing.
Can you answer it?
What's the next item...
on the programme?
