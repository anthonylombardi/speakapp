How tall are you?
I'm very tall.
I can't wait to see you!
Wait for me - I won't be long.
I wasn't going to,
but maybe I will.
I greatly appreciate...
the experience I gained...
working for that company.
I always felt personally involved...
in the success of a campaign.
Do you have any weak points?
I've been told...
I'm a perfectionist.
I set very high standards -
sometimes too high, I'm afraid
You needn't apologise.
I tend to do the same thing myself.
I've been with this company...
for twenty five years.
I've lived in this city...
all my life.
We've always wantedâ€¦
to go to South America,
but we've never been able...
to afford it.
How long have you had this car?
We've only had it...
for a couple of months.

We bought it two months ago.
How long have you been married?
We've been married...
for fifteen years.
All our products are made...
from recycled plastic.
The retail price...
for this item...
is seventy nine.
Never underestimate...
the power of a woman.
The food was overcooked.
The flight was overbooked.
The police had to use tear gas...
to get the crowd moving.
In the country of the blind...
the one-eyed man is king.
For twenty four-hours...
you're asked to protest...
by not buying anything,
to spend time with family and friends,
rather than spend money.
How would you define it...
in political terms?
It's an attack...
on consumerist culture.
What about online shopping?
Whether online or on the street...
it's all the same.
Enough is as good as a feast.
I hope you don't mind my asking...
but you're British, aren't you?
Yes, I'm Welsh, from Cardiff.
Exercise is good for you...
but you shouldn't overdo it.
People tend to overeat...
when they're depressed.
