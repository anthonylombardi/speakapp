Leave me a message...
and I'll get back to you...
as soon as I can.
Goodbye and take care.
I'm looking for a wedding present.
My cousin's getting married next week.
What did you have in mind?
What's the forecast for tomorrow?
It's going to be a lovely day.
Not too hot and not too cold.
Shall we go for a walk in the country?
Look at this traffic!
We're going to be late!
The shops close in ten minutes.
We'll never get there in time.
We had meetings...
all day, every-day,
before signing the contract.
Eventually we made a deal...
to share the shipping costs.
Now everyone will be expected...
to work overtime...
till the end of the month.
an hour's drive
last year's sales figures
You've made very good progress...
over the last few weeks.
I have my own way...
of doing things.
What made you decide...
to leave Global Fashions?

I was offered a better job...
with really interesting prospects.
I was in charge...
of the Customer Service Department.
What computer programs...
are you familiar with?
I can use Word and Excel.
What would you consider...
to be your strong points?
I'm reliable,
and I learn quickly.
After finishing high school,
I went straight to university.
Later on, I realised...
I'd made a serious mistake.
Travel broadens the mind.
Guests are advised ...
not to leave valuable items...
in their rooms.
I had a very happy childhood.
A child's character is formed...
early on in life.
You keep saying the same things...
over and over.
Have you got a double room...
for tonight and tomorrow night?
How much is the room?
One hundred twenty...
pounds a night.
Could you sign the register?
Here's your key.
Hurry up! 
It's getting late.
We have to check in...
at least an hour before the flight.
Where did you get that camera?
I got it in Hong Kong.
You should try to study...
at least an hour a day.
The parcel got held up at Customs.
It was Charles who solved the problem.
