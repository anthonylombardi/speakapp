We were given...
a list of campsites...
by the local tourist bureau.
He was never told...
the whole story, was he?
No one will ever know the truth, will they?
However you look at it,
politics is a dirty game.
We can leave...
whenever you're ready.
Nevertheless we ought to go soon.
That's fine with me.
Whichever road we take...
we're going to hit traffic.
The spring was cold and wet.
The summer was long, hot and humid.
At certain times of the year...
Mars can be seen...
with the naked eye.
I always say...
why lose sleep...
over things that may never happen?
When are you going to answer those letters?
When are you going to finish that report?
Never put off till tomorrow...
what you can do today.
forty words a minute
fifty miles an hour
twenty four-hours a day
seven days a week

Could you tell me...
where I'm supposed to sit?
Ask the flight attendant to help you.
Passengers are allowed...
only one item of hand luggage.
Please put your coats...
in the overhead lockers.
Make sure your seatbelt is fastened...
and that your mobile phone...
is switched off.
Where is the nearest...
emergency exit?
It's further down on the left.
We're going out for a walk...
along the seafront.
Would you care to join us?
Ten kilometres...
is too far to walk in this heat.
I'm not following you.
I didn't catch what you said.
I'm afraid they're not prepared...
to accept your explanation.
I'm not sure what that means.
I'd rather not discuss it,
if you don't mind.
Don't let things get you down.
We didn't get to see...
the Sistine Chapel.
We got there too late.
Without a valid passport...
you won't be allowed...
to leave the country.
Frankly, I couldn't care less.
This service is suspended...
until further notice.
What are we supposed to do now?
