A politician and his assistant were on safari in Africa.
A lion jumped out in front of them and started snarling.
The assistant said, "What should we do?"
The politician replied, "I'm going to run for my life."
The assistant cried, "We'll never be able to outrun a lion!"
The politician started sprinting and said,
"I don't have to outrun the lion my friend,
I only have to outrun you."
Better to be alone than in bad company.
Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones.
When the cat's away, the mice will play.
I told the mechanic...
to check the brakes.
Then I asked him...
to look at the battery.
He advised me to sell the car...
before it fell to pieces.
I promised my mother...
I'd be home for her birthday...
but my flight's been cancelled.
I asked them how they felt...
about their relationship.
