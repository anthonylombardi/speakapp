Attending a wedding for the first time,
a little girl whispered to her mother,
Why is the bride dressed in white?
The mother replied,
Because white is the colour of happiness,
and today is the happiest day of her life.
The child thought about this for a moment, then said,
So why is the groom wearing black?

I'm coming to Newcastle.
What about meeting for lunch?
I'll be free around one.
We're going to take off in five minutes
What about going out for a meal?
That sounds great.
It's difficult to remember...
all these rules.
Learning a foreign language...
takes time and patience.
To begin with, Ann is very sick today.
Likewise, Alice is nervous about the exam.
Jack doesn't feel well, but he refuses to see a doctor.
Frankly speaking, I think he's being quite foolish.
Sue's being very quiet today.
I wonder if anything is wrong.
generous, funny, fair, kind and logical
cruel, illogical, impolite, irresponsible and lazy
I'll begin to study at seven ...
whereas you'll be here at eight.
In other words, I'll be studying when you come.
Don't call me at nine because I won't be home.
I'm going to be shopping at the mall.
Don't get impatient. 
She'll be coming soon.
Don't get irritated. 
It'll only make you feel worse.
