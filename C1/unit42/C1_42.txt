My friend enjoyed the party.
The student studies in the library.
We appreciated your help in the matter.
We went to the zoo in the afternoon.
Does he live in Chicago?
No, he doesn't.
Where does he live?
I'm not completely sure, 
but I believe in Detroit.
Will she be living there?
Where will she be living?
Who lives there?
How are things?
Pretty terrible, actually.
My car won't start and my clients won't pay.
We're going to have to shut the window...
to keep out the mosquitoes.
I'm afraid we won't be able...
to come on Monday.
When's the deadline?
Everything will have to be ready...
by the end of August.
All the information you need...
is in these folders.
Brainstorming is an excellent way...
of finding creative solutions.

I haven't seen him since he left this morning.
I've known Marc ever since I was a child.
We stayed there until we finished our work.
As soon as it stops raining, we'll leave.
I'll never speak to him again as long as I live.
Whenever I see Alex, I say hello.
The first time I visited Milan,
I went to an opera.
