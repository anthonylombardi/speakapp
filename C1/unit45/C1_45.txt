The students in the class come from many countries.
One of them is from Mexico while another is from Iraq.
Others are from Brazil while others are from Algeria.
I have three books. 
Two are mine.
The other book is yours. 
The other is yours.
Meanwhile, I'll be here for another three years.
All the same, I need another five dollars.
Despite that, we drove another ten miles.
Anyhow, let's go to a movie.
Anyway, let's not go to a movie.
At any rate, let's stay home instead.
Why don't we go to a movie?
Why don't you come around seven?
Why don't I give Mary a call?
Shall I open the window? 
Is that OK with you?
Shall we leave at two?
Let's go, shall we?
Let's go, OK?
We love having guests...
and we've got plenty of room.
What do you think I should do?
I wouldn't do anything.
I'd wait and see what happens.
Electronic devices...
may not be used during the flight.
Could you tell me...
when to get off ...
at Trafalgar Square?
Wouldn't it be fun to learn sailing!

May I use your mobile for a second?
You may leave your name at the reception.
He might be here in a short time.
Might I borrow your pen?
No doubt about it, you should get one for yourself.
In any case, she should do well on the test.
You'd better be on time, or we'll start without you.
The meeting is supposed to begin at eight o'clock sharp.
It's rather urgent that you are present.
It shouldn't be a problem at all.
I really must try to improve my living situation.
Quite honestly, you mustn't go on like this.
That's exactly why I have to speak with Karen today.
Since she isn't here now, she must be sick.
She'll certainly be here tomorrow.
The phone's ringing.
I'll get it.
She says she's going to be here at six.
In that case, I'm going to call it off.
I can't go on like this.
Anyway, you can use my car tomorrow if you like.
Can I use the satellite navigator as well?
Could you be careful about talking like that?
You could get me in trouble.
That couldn't be further from the truth!
I'll be able to help you if everything works out.
Would you please pass the salt?
Would you mind if I left early?
I would much rather go for a walk than stay home.
I'd like an apple, please.
