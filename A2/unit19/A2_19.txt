It was snowing...
 when they got to the hotel.
 They checked in at the desk...
 and went up to get dressed...
 for the dinner party.
 ‘Do I really have to wear a tie?’
 ‘Yes, dear. It's going to be...
 a very smart occasion.
 You should wear your new shirt.’
 An hour later,
 they went down to the dining room...
 to meet the other guests.
 It began to rain...
 while we were having lunch.
 Sally took off her sunglasses.
 I gave her the ring...
 and she put it on.
 a powerful lap-top computer
 a high-speed laser printer
 Olivia downloaded the program
 onto the hard disk.
 She read the instructions on the screen.
 Do you wear glasses?
 No, I wear contact lenses.
 Have you ever been to the Seychelles?
 No, I haven't.
 Where are they exactly?
 they are a group of islands...
 east of Africa ...
 in the Indian Ocean.
 Pam and I went there...
 last year.
 We want to go back again...
 next year.
 That's interesting.
 I'll have to go there sometime.
