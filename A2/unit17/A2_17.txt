Do you feel better this morning?
 No, I've still got a temperature.
 Shall I phone the doctor?
 That's a good idea.
 But the surgery isn't open yet.
 Well, I'll phone in half an hour.
 Why don't you stay in bed...
 and try to sleep?
 I think you should take...
 another pill.
 I'll get you a glass of water.
 Here you are.
 What's the problem?
 I've got a terrible pain...
 in my back.
 Do your legs hurt too?
 Yes, they do.
 I can hardly walk.
 Have you had this before?
 Yes, I get it about once a year.
 Here's the prescription.
 Take one tablet after every meal.
 Thank you, doctor.
 How long should I take them for?
 Ten days should be enough.
 I can't play golf.
 Can you teach me?
 Hold the club like this.
 Put your left hand here...
 and your right hand here.
 Keep your feet apart...
 and your head down.
 And keep your eye on the ball.
 Today's Tuesday, isn't it?
