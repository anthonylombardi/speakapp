What's the problem?
What can I do for you?
I need some information.
I need your advice.
Business wasn't very good last year,
but this year it's better.
Hello?
Sorry, I can't hear you.
The kids are making too much noise.
What are they doing?
Ann's watching a video...
in the living room.
Paul's listening to rock music...
in his bedroom.
What are you doing?
I'm busy in the kitchen.
I'm trying to make dinner.
Well, I'll call back...
a little later.
How's that big project going?
Well, we're making progress.
Slowly but surely.
That's good to hear.
In fact, we expect to finish...
by the end of the month.
What about you?
We're having some problems...
in the office.
Well, don't get depressed.
Let me buy you a drink.
Thanks, but it's getting late.
Maybe next time.

The phone's ringing.
Can you answer it?
Sorry, I can't.
I'm washing my hair.
Well, I'm cooking dinner.
Let it ring, then.
They can leave a message...
on the answering machine.
The swimming pool was crowded.
There were too many people...
and there was too much noise.
I did my homework.
I made a mistake.
The company is growing.
Business is improving.
We're selling our products...
all over the world.
I can't see the road signs.
There's too much fog.
I didn't buy that coat.
It was too expensive.
The test was too long.
The questions were too difficult. 
I got to school just in time.
I got home very late.
Where are you going...
for your holidays this year?
We're going to Dubai in June.
Didn't you go there last year?
Yes, we did.
We really liked it,
so we're going again.
