How long have you known Susan?
 I've known her for a while.
 Do you know her husband?
 No, I've never met him.
 I won't be able...
 to meet you this afternoon,
 but I should be able...
 to see you tomorrow morning.
 I've got to go to the bank today.
 I've got to get some cash.
 I've only got...
 two thousand in the bank.
 How long have you been married?
 We've been married...
 for fifteen years.
 We met in the Bahamas.
 We got married in Moscow.
 We've lived in Kenya...
 since last year.
 That's a nice cabin bag.
 Is it new?
 No, I've had it for a while.
 I've had it since Christmas.
 speak - spoke - spoken
 write - wrote - written
 ‘Saturday’ is written...
 with a capital S.
 Have we got time for a walk...
 before lunch?
 Yes, it's only eleven-thirty.
 see - saw - seen
 be - was - been
 I haven't seen you for ages.
 How long has it been?

a couple of weeks
 a couple of months
 a couple of years
 We can't afford...
 to miss this opportunity.
 I didn't know you spoke Russian.
 I was having lunch...
 the other day...
 in a restaurant near my office.
 The couple at the next table...
 were eating their meal in silence.
 After a while, the young man said,
 ‘What are you thinking about, darling?’
 The girl stopped eating...
 and looked at him tenderly.
 ‘I was thinking, my dear,
 that silence must be a sign of love.’
 An attempted robbery...
 at a local grocer's shop...
 failed last night.
 One of the robbers...
 was wearing a blonde wig...
 and a long white dress.
 The other was wearing...
 a fancy dress costume.
 When the cashier saw them,
 she screamed so much...
 that they ran away,
 leaving the money on the floor...
 in a blue plastic shopping bag.
